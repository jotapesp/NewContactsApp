# NewContactsApp

First version of the app. This is a Contacts app that will store a contact using
classes and objects. Each contact is an object that will store a list of teleph-
ones, which are also objects. The user can run this app on the command line by
typing "python app.py [file_name]" where file_name is optional. If you are using
the app for the first time, you likely do not have any file to pass its name in
the command line, therefore, type only "python app.py". In case you have already
used the app and saved the contacts list in a file, you can either parse its na-
me in the command line or use the function in the app menu to load the file.
